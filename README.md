**Prior expectations in visual speed perception 
quantitatively predict encoding characteristics of neurons in area MT**  
Ling-Qi Zhang, Alan A. Stocker (2021)  

** Behavior Prior
- run /behavior/mainOpt.m for model fitting 
- subjects psychophysical data can be found under /behavior/NN2006

** Neural Prior
- run /neural/fitDataGauss.m for tuning curve fitting and compute Fisher information
- data for individual neurons can be found under /neural/DeAngelis
