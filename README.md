## Usage
**Behavior Prior Analysis**
- Run `/behavior/mainOpt.m` for model fitting and extracting the behavior prior
- Subjects psychophysical data can be found under `/behavior/NN2006` 


**Neural Prior Analysis**
- Run `/neural/fitDataGauss.m` for tuning curve fitting and compute Fisher information
- Data for individual neurons can be found under `/neural/DeAngelis` courtesy of Dr. Greg DeAngelis
